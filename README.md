# Landing Page Project

**This code is my contribution to the second required project in Udacity's Front End Web Developer & Digital Freelancing Nanodegree Program**

### Features

This project creates a smooth scrolling navigation system with the following features:

- Active Sections: Based on the user's scroll position, highlights the currently visible section and its corresponding navigation link.
- Smooth Scrolling: Clicking on a navigation link smoothly scrolls the user to the corresponding section.
- Scroll-to-Top Button: A button appears when the user scrolls past a certain point, allowing them to easily return to the top.
- Hidden fixed navigation bar while not scrolling.
- Collapsible Sections: Clicking on a section header toggles the visibility of its content.
- Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

### Installation

This script is directly included in the HTML file and CSS is loaded. No additional setup is required.

### Additonal Notes
